# Dearest Jáque

So I know it wasn't necessarily your intention to get me involved but surely you can see in hindsight how obvious it was that I would get dragged in.
I have stayed completely out of everything. I stayed out of miles and Emily’s issues and I stayed out of Emily and Lissy's debacle also because it is family and it is not my business.

Its funny you say that you and Emily have both lost your best friends because miles and lissy are saying the exact same thing:

![Miles misses you a lot](img/miles_statement.png)


![Lissy miss emily a lot plus shes a gay](img/lissy_statement.png)

I obviously showed them the messages you sent to me to preserve transparency, and I’ll be sending this as well.

> "I had no idea Emily was gonna contact lissie and i promise you I had no part in that. The only reason I told her is because I was genuinely concerned for miles, i know what he's like and when you tell me you're worried about how much drugs he's doing, it kinda shook me up.”

I completely understand that now man but **GOT DAMN** I wish you’d confirmed with me before telling Emily as I would have told you to hold back on that front.
#Summary
As Switzerland, I am hearing both sides of the story and everyone is saying exactly the same thing.

* Miles wont talk to you because you wont talk to him first and you wont talk to him because he wont talk to you first
* Lissy misses Emily more than anything and Emily misses her (that’s from you I actually haven’t spoken to Emily)
* All 4 of you wanna suck on ma dick

If this is the case you should all draw a line in the sand and become friends again right?

I have a lot more to say, but that would mean I am getting involved.

I’m 80% sure that what I have to say will fix you and miles, and 100% sure it contains things you don’t want to hear.

As for Emily and lissy that’s a little out of my depth as I dont know them well enough but I do have a little to say on the subject.

If you want to hear these things I am happy to share them with you but I do not want you to consider me as getting involved and I definitely dont want any reprocussions to myself for it. Everything I have done and said is out of peace and love.

I fucking hate my family fighting and all 4 of you are at fault. There should not be this much arguing over it tho. It’s gone on looooong enuf.
